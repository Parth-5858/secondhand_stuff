The trunk of any watch or else say Band of any watch is the most important part of a watch which occupies most of the part of it's outer part, if this part isn't made beautiful than there is no meaning of diamond studding on any other part of the watch so we have also tried our best to compliment it, cartier makes beautiful watches and we add to its beauty to make it more royal, the fully diamond studded band os here, the more space to occupy the more tougher to stud diamonds around, still we haven't allowed any glitches and difficulties to make it a quality product.

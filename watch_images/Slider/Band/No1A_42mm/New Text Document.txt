This gorgeous looking Royal Oak band consisting of lock-buckle made with tiny buns is a piece of art itself. Now to complement this Royal Oak band we have furnished this band the most precious stone called diamonds 

Each piece of diamond is stud between a couple of 2 diamonds on the whole-body portion covering almost cent percent of the body which seems as it’s a piece of diamond work not just a metallic band. This adorable bit is only exclusive to MTJ World.

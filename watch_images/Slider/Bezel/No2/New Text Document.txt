This is a same bezel as above but there a difference, the diamonds arranged here is in grid type of arrangement i.e. 1 diamond surrounded by 4 other diamonds and covering the whole bezel, this is a perfect mixture of different sizes of diamonds arranged in beautiful manner camouflaging a diamond product instead a mettalic showpiece.

No glitches, no mishap, just an outstanding example of up to what extend we can go when it’s the question of perfection. You’ll find this nowhere but only at one station and that’s MTJ World.
